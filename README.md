# Dash_Data-Visualization-Apps

With Dash, a productive Python framework for building web applications, we can create data visualization apps with custom user interfaces in Python. In this project, I explored Dash and try to add some user interfaces to plots created by Ploty.

The documentation of Dash: https://dash.plotly.com/

For this project, the dataset I am going to use is Data_Cortex_Nuclear.xls with a dimensionality of more than 2. At first, I reduced the dimensionality of this dataset to two by using 3 dimensionality reduction techniques PCA, ISOMAP, and t-SNE. Then, I plotted a scatter plot for each technique. You can choose which plot to show using radio buttons. 



You can also choose 2 features from the main dataset and only have a scatter plot for these two features as axes. Then, you can add(delete) a scatter plot with the same features you chose under the mentioned plot.
